## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Manipulating the layout for mobile vs desktop
2. Using "filter" & "mix-blend-mode"

```scss
.card img {
  border-radius: 15px 15px 0 0;
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
  filter: opacity(0.8);
}
```

### Continued development

Work more with: SCSS | Image overlays | Flexbox.
